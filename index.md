# Hey stranger! 

Welcome to my website! I'm happy to see you here. 

Let me introduce myself. My name is Maria and I am a Data Scientist that lives in Italy, near Milan. For the past 5 years I worked for [Voltaware](https://voltaware.com/), an Energy Monitoring startup based in London. I was pleased to collaborate with an amazing team, and challenge myself solving complex Data Analytics problems. 

I am a curious human being and I am constantly looking for something new to learn and experiment with. 
At the moment I am upskilling by taking a few online courses and experimenting with the learned concepts. I am currently focusing on AWS and Generative AI. I am also playing around with a few tools that are helping me being more productive (Vim and Bash). 

Besides Data Science, I'm also into photography, hiking and tennis.
